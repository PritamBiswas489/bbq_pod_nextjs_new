  "faq1Question": "How long does delivery take?",
  "faq1Answer": "From order confirmation, delivery and installation typically take up to 16 weeks. In quieter periods this can be closer to 14 weeks, depending on production schedules and your chosen specification. We'll always confirm lead times before securing your order.",
  "faq2Question": "What warranty is included?",
  "faq2Answer": "All BBQ Pods come with a 10-year structural warranty and a 2-year warranty on appliances, as detailed in our brochure. This covers normal residential use and manufacturing defects.",
  "faq3Question": "What is required for installation?",
  "faq3Answer": "The pod must be installed on solid, level ground capable of supporting its weight. An external electrical socket is required, along with a water supply and waste connection if a sink is included. Due to the weight of the units, suitable access for delivery and crane placement is also necessary.",
  "faq4Question": "Can the BBQ Pod be used year-round?",
  "faq4Answer": "Yes. BBQ Pods are designed for outdoor living in the Spanish climate. When closed, the interior remains clean and protected from dust and rain. When open, integrated shading and lighting allow comfortable outdoor cooking throughout the year.",
  "faq5Question": "How do I choose the right model?",
  "faq5Answer": "The right model depends on your available space, how you plan to use the pod, and your preferred features. We're happy to advise and can prepare a visualisation to help you choose with confidence.",
  "faq6Question": "What maintenance is required?",
  "faq6Answer": "Maintenance is simple and minimal. Regular cleaning of cooking surfaces and occasional care of stainless-steel areas will keep your BBQ Pod performing and looking its best.",
  "faq7Question": "Can I customise the pod after ordering?",
  "faq7Answer": "All major customisation is completed before production begins. Once an order is confirmed, changes are limited, so we'll guide you through all options carefully to ensure everything is right from the start.",
  "faq8Question": "Need Further Information?",
